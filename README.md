# objectdetectionyolov7

Implemented an object detection system using YOLOv7, leveraging its real-time performance and accuracy. Labeled images and created a custom dataset for training using annotation tools like LabelImg/Roboflow. Optimized model training by fine-tuning hyperparameters and applying data augmentation techniques to enhance detection precision. Integrated the trained model with OpenCV for real-time inference and post-processing. Analyzed performance metrics such as IoU, and inference speed to ensure optimal detection efficiency.
